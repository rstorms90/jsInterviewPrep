## Advantages of OOP?

- OOP provides a clear modular structure for programs
- Great for defining abstract data types
- Easy to maintain and modify existing code as new objects
  can be created with small differences to existing ones

## Encapsulation

The core idea of OOP — creating a blueprint, a template that has a class, encapsulating a
bunch of (a little package of an object) data and functionality together.

### Why is encapsulation important?

Encapsulation helps in isolating implementation details from the behavior exposed to clients of a class (other classes/functions that are using this class), and gives you more control over coupling in your code.

```
public class Car
{
  //...
  public float GetFuelPercentage() { /* ... */ };

  //...

  private float gasoline;
  //...
}
```

Note that the client using the function which gives you the amount of fuel in the car doesn't care what type of fuel does the car use. This abstraction separates the concern (Amount of fuel) from unimportant (in this context) detail: whether it is gas, oil or anything else.

The second thing is that author of the class is free to do anything they want with the internals of the class, for example changing gasoline to oil, and other things, as long as they don't change its behaviour. This is thanks to the fact, that they can be sure that no one depends on these details, because they are private. The fewer dependencies there are in the code the more flexible and easier to maintain it is.

## Inheritance

Once you have made a class and you want a class to inherit properties or functions, but modified
with its own custom data.

## Polymorphism

```
class Particle {

}

class Confetti extends Particle {

}

Confetti c = new Confetti();

// Allowed because Confetti extends Particle
Particle c = new Confetti();
```
